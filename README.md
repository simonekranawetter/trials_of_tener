# trials_of_tener
Epic CSS battle inspired by Tener aka clayboone


1) Build me a website. i don't care how you do it. make something hostable and host it on aws or netlify or just ngrok. make it say "hello world" in the vertical and horizontal center.
2) Put an image at the top of the page. the image must be flush with the top edge of the viewport.
  The image can be grown for larger/wider screens, but must never be shrunk for smaller screens. instead, the horizontal center of the image must remain in the horizontal center
  of the screen. Use this (provided) image. it matches an ultrawide aspect, with a helpful arrow drawn pointing to the center of (1720, 0).
